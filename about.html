				<h1>About Me</h1>
				<p>In April 2017 I finally made the move to living as a full time RVer.  That basically means my RV is my home on wheels.  I am free to travel as much or as little as I desire.  This means that I now have the time to pursue my love of hiking at a much greater level.</p>
				<br>
				<p>I try not to be set to a specific schedule.  I may move around on a weekly basis, or I may find a spot for months at a time.  I love finding free campsites to disperse camp (boondock).  By a river or lake, in the mountains or desert, on public lands wherever it is allowed.  Anywhere I can find some hiking in the area, or just to explore the vastly different areas of this country.</p>
				<br>
				<p>There are times I will find either work or volunteer opportunities, staying for months at a time.  This allows me the opportunity to earn some extra income, or to settle down in one area for a longer period of time, in order to have more time to explore.</p>
				<br>
				<p>I always enjoyed hiking, but never had a lot of time to pursue it very much.  I try to hike on a regular basis now.  I will never say hiking is easy.  You have to work hard.  It's physically challenging, yet highly rewarding.  It doesn't matter if you are hiking easy trails or if you are taking on challenging terrain, there is hiking opportunities for everyone at every skill level.  The rewards are many.  To name a few: Exercise is good for your health, getting back to nature is relaxing, endless scenery to discover around the next bend, like forests, fields of flowers, wildlife, rivers, lakes, waterfalls, mountain summits, scenic views, etc.  Plus you will meet so many interesting people on the trails, from all different walks of life!</p>
				<br>
				<p>I hope I can inspire you to get outdoors, go rving or camping, travel to new areas, go for walks or hikes, find peace that comes from getting away from the normal busy lives we all experience daily, and just get out and live life!  I hope you enjoy my website.  I designed it to share some of my experiences hiking and RVing.</p>
